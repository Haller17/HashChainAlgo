# HashChainAlgo
A personal extension of my BIU research: A colleague (at Bar-Ilan) and I wrote a Python hash-chained logger that verifies every simulation run which makes any tampering detectable. This is to ensure each simulation is recorded and verifiable. Any modification breaks the chain and fails the verification test.
