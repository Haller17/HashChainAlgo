# HashChainAlgo
A personal extension of my BIU research: I wrote a Python hash-chained logger that verifies every simulation run which makes any tampering detectable.

I implemented a Python tamper evident audit log (SHA-256 hash chain) to ensure each simulation is recorded and verifiable. Any modification breaks the chain and fails the verification test.
